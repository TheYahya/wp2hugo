# WordPress to Hugo

The best migrator for migrating WordPress export to Hugo.
Written in Go.

## Goals

1. [] Migrate posts
1. [] Migrate pages
1. [] Migrate tags
1. [] Migrate categories
1. [] Migrate URLs correctly
1. [] Migrate iframe(s) like YouTube embeds
1. [] Migrate "Show more..."

Various options can be seen [here](https://gohugo.io/tools/migrations/) that are partially good.

1. Export via https://<website>/wp-admin/export.php
1. The problem is that there is no good tool to perform the next import into Hugo
